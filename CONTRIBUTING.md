git checkout -b feature/improve-osc-logging
```

### 3. Make Changes

Ensure your code:
- Is clean, readable, and consistent with existing style.
- Uses British spelling (e.g., *initialise*, *normalise*).
- Includes summary comments on all public methods and classes.

### 4. Run Tests

Before submitting a pull request, run all available tests:

```bash
# In Unity: Run PlayMode and EditMode tests via Test Runner.
# Or use Unity Test Framework via CLI if configured.
```

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Inspiration and Attribution

RTML Tool Kit draws conceptual inspiration from [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org), a GUI-based interactive machine learning system. RTML is built from scratch in C# for native Unity integration, especially targeting **Mixed Reality** workflows and **Android** deployment where Wekinator cannot operate.
